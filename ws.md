## Workshop on Computational Linguistics on East Asian Languages

A one-day workshop on Computational Linguistics on East Asian
Languages will be held as an *online event* on 31 July 2022, in
conjunction with The 29th International Conference on Head-driven
Phrase Structure Grammar (29-30 July 2022).

The aim of the workshop is to promote interdisciplinary and
cross-language discussion on approaches to linguistic analyses using
computational techniques (broadly construed), with a focus on East
Asian Languages. We strongly encourage researchers from outside the
HPSG framework to submit.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to syntactic/semantic
parsing, cognitive modelling with computational models, development of
language resources with annotations beyond the word level (treebanks,
propbanks, discourse annotations, etc.), applications of large-scale
corpus data and/or sophisticated machine learning techniques to
addressing questions in linguistic theory.


### Invited speaker

Koji Mineshima (Keio University)


### Workshop format 

Same as the main conference. Presentations will be pre-recorded and
pre-loaded on the conference website, and the discussion period will
be online.


### Submissions

We welcome two types of submissions for the workshop: 

- Long papers (4-page abstract + 1 page data, figures & references; 20
  minute pre-recorded presentation + 15 minute online discussion)

- Short papers (2-page abstract + 1 page data, figures & references;
  10 minute pre-recorded presentation + 10 minute online discussion)

Please note that abstracts submitted for the "long paper" track can be
accepted as "short papers" (and vice versa). Only "long papers" will
appear in the proceedings.

Please choose the option Computational Linguistics Workshop as your
Submission Type.

All abstracts should be submitted in PDF format via: 
[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpsg22]

All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by at least two reviewers.
The submissions should not include the authors' names, and authors are
asked to avoid self-references. Please direct any questions to the
Program Committee Chair: Elodie Winckel (hpsg22@easychair.org).
