## Workshop on Computational Linguistics on East Asian Languages

A one-day workshop on Computational Linguistics on East Asian
Languages will be held on 31 July 2022, in conjunction with The 29th
International Conference on Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar
(29-30 July 2022).

The aim of the workshop is to promote interdisciplinary and
cross-language discussion on approaches to linguistic analyses using
computational techniques (broadly construed), with a focus on East
Asian Languages. We strongly encourage researchers from outside the
HPSG framework to submit.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to syntactic/semantic
parsing, cognitive modelling with computational models, development of
language resources with annotations beyond the word level (treebanks,
propbanks, discourse annotations, etc.), applications of large-scale
corpus data and/or sophisticated machine learning techniques to
addressing questions in linguistic theory.
