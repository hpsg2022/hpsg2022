## Call for Papers

We welcome two types of submissions for the main HPSG conference: 

- Long papers (4-page abstract + 1 page data, figures & references; 20
  minute pre-recorded presentation + 15 minute online discussion)
- Short papers (2-page abstract + 1 page data, figures & references;
  10 minute pre-recorded presentation + 10 minute online discussion)

Please note that abstracts submitted for the "long paper" track can be
accepted as "short papers" (and vice versa). Only "long papers" will
appear in the proceedings.

All abstracts should be submitted in PDF format via: 
[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpsg22](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpsg22)


All abstracts will be reviewed anonymously by at least two reviewers.
The submissions should not include the authors' names, and authors are
asked to avoid self-references. Please direct any questions to the
Program Committee Chair: Elodie Winckel (hpsg22@easychair.org).

A call for contributions to the proceedings will be issued after the
Conference. Proceedings of previous conferences are available at:
